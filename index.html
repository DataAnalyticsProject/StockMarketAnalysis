                    The purpose of this project is to analyze how the 30 components within the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) has been affected during COVID-19. 
                    To accomplish this analysis, we will compare each component to the DJI.

                    The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is the second-oldest and best-known stock market index. 
                    Owned by Dow Jones & Company, it measures the daily price movements of 30 large American companies on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. 
                    It is widely viewed as a proxy for general market conditions and even the U.S. economy itself. 
                    Started in 1896, the DJIA is comprised of blue-chip stocks, approximately two-thirds of which are represented by companies producing industrial and consumer goods. 
                    The rest are chosen from all the major sectors of the economy including information technology, entertainment, and financial services.
